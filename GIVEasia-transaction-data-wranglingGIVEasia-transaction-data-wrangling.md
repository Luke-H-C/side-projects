# About GIVEasia
GIVEasia is a crowdfunding platform for people to raise money online. It offers services similar to [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/). Instead of charging transaction fees, it relies on optional "tips" from users to cover operational expenses. For example, use can donate $100 to a campaign and pay an optional $10 tip to GIVEasia. 

# The Problem
Since it was founded, thousands of transactions have been recorded in the database. When a user makes a donation on GIVEasia, a new row of the transaction record is created. Here is a sample transaction record:

Column| Field (String) | Example 
------|-------|--------
Date | Timestamp of donation | 1 Jun 2017 06:33:40 +0800
Name | Username | LukeHC or Anonymous
E-mail | email | Test@gmail.com
Charity |	organization who receives the money | RED CROSS TAIWAN
Movement | which fundraising campaign | Help Typhoon Victms
Amount | donation amount | SGD 20.00
Net Amount | donation amount without paymeny processing fee	| SGD 19.60
